# Edge Cover Calculator and Simplifier for Graphs

This calculator takes a user inputted graph and returns the total number of edge covers and a formula in terms of Fibonacci numbers. This is accomplished by applying the Cutting-Open Lemma: a method of splitting and adding edges onto the graph to simplify it down into path graphs, which have a direct correlation to the Fibonacci sequence. This allows the total edge covers to be calculated easier.
